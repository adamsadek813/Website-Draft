		<h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <h4>COM-IoT Technologies</h4>
		<p>In high school and college I interned with COM-IoT, a Dubai-based artificial intelligence company.
    During my time there, I learned about how data collected by sensors mounted to a vehicle can be utilized
    by machine learning algorithms to help traffic control protect lives through better traffic violation
    detection. Learning about how software engineers  build machine learning algorithms to identify objects
    and the speed of moving vehicles reinforced in my mind the potential for artificial intelligence and
    machine learning to make the world a safer place. </p>


    <h3>Education</h3>
    <h3>Highschool - Dubai American Academy</h3>
    <h4>Certificate of Achievement High Honors with Distinction (GPA of 4.0 or above)</h4>
    <p> I achieved this award every semester of 11th and 12th grade and once in the first semester of 10th grade.
        This certificate is a testament to my strong work ethic that I have developed at a young age. To achieve
        this award I had to be able to excel in my six international baccalaureate courses and perform on
        assessments remarkably well on a  regular basis.</p>
    <h4>Subject Award IB Physics SL 11th Grade</h4>
    <p> Once a year, one IB SL Physics student was chosen as the SL physics student of the year. This person is
        selected based on their outstanding achievements in that subject. When I received this award, I had a 98
        percent in SL physics. This was higher than any other SL physics student in the school.</p>
    <h4>International Baccalaureate Higher Level Information Technology in a Global Society</h4>
    <p>This class exposed me to the social and ethical implications of how humans use IT. An example of this
        that interests me is the utilization of virtual reality for therapy, allowing for improved treatment of PTSD,
        paranoia, and certain phobias. </p>


    <h3>College - Illinois Institute of Technology</h3>
    <h4>Dean’s List</h4>
    <p>For both semesters that I have completed at Illinois Institute of Technology, I have been on the Dean’s
    list. I currently maintain an overall GPA of 3.83 and I expect to improve my GPA in the future.
    Academic focus and discipline has always been one of my strong suits.</p>
